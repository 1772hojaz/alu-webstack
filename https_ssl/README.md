SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) is a standard technology for securing an internet connection by encrypting data sent between a website and a browser, or between two servers. It is used to establish an encrypted connection, preventing hackers from seeing or stealing any information transferred, including personal or financial data. TLS (Transport Layer Security) is an updated, more secure version of SSL, and the terms are often used interchangeably. When you buy an SSL certificate, you actually get the most trusted, up-to-date TLS certificates. HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) appears in the URL when a website is secured by an SSL certificate. It is essential for keeping user activity private and encrypts and protects usernames, passwords, and other personal information
